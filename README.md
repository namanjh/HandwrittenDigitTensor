# HandwrittenDigitTensor
This is a project based on training  a model using the dataset of images of digits from 0-9. The model is trained using CNN and the model accuracy is around 97.5%. The training data contains 4000 images for each digits. The prediction can be done directly using the tensor (image). This is a basic model based on a new approach for prediction and training from the images rather than using MNIST Dataset.
All the details of the project is given below:
